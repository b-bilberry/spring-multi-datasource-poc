This POC checks how [Spring Framework AbstractRoutingDataSource](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/lookup/AbstractRoutingDataSource.html)
can be implemented as data source for the  [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) and [MyBatis](https://mybatis.org/mybatis-3/).

This simple POC bounded to [Flyway](https://www.red-gate.com/products/flyway/community/) tables. But it won't be a challenge to change this.
